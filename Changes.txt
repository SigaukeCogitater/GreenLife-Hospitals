<-------------------------Start Home Work Two---------------------------->

	We created a knew directory for our website.
	In the folder we followed a basic structure of putting image, css, and javascript folder.
	We downloaded and put jquery and bootstrap javascrip and css libraries in their respective folders.
	We used a lot of online lessons from platforms such as coursera, youtube, w3 schools in order to implement some of the things we did not know e.t.c
	We chose bootstrap because of it's awesome grid and fluid functions which allowed us to create a fluid layout without 
	worry much of css @media querry.
	It also helped us remove some defalt browser elements.
	However we created our own stles.css to override the imported style sheets.
	Created the about, home, contact us, staff, weekly schedule, and department pages.
	We manage to create a navigation bar and some main content for the entire website.
	Right now we will be working of some content and interactivity of the website.
