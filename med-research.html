Chronic pain affects ~20% of the European population and is commoner in women, older people, and with relative deprivation. Its management in the community remains generally unsatisfactory, partly because of lack of evidence for effective interventions. Epidemiological study of chronic pain, through an understanding of its distribution and determinants, can inform the development, targeting, and evaluation of interventions in the general population. This paper reviews current knowledge of risk markers associated with chronic pain and considers how these might inform management and prevention. Risk factors include socio-demographic, clinical, psychological, and biological factors. These are relevant to our understanding of chronic pain mechanisms and the nature of, and responses to, current and future treatments. <br /><br />

Epidemiology is the 'study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations and the applications of this study to control health problems'.1 Good epidemiological research on chronic pain provides important information on prevalence and factors associated with its onset and persistence. Improving our understanding of associated factors will inform our clinical management, limiting severity, and minimizing disability.
<br /><br />
There is a strong argument that the most recent estimations of global burden of disease have underestimated the contribution of chronic pain.2 By 2030, the WHO predicts that the four leading contributors of global burden of disease will be unipolar depression, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and road traffic accidents.3 Chronic pain is an important co-morbidity associated with all of these. But chronic pain is more than just a co-morbidity of other identifiable disease or injury. Chronic pain is now acknowledged as a condition in its own right, underpinned by an agreed set of definitions and taxonomy.4,5
<br /><br />
Approximately 20% of the adult European population have chronic pain6 and, in addition to the physical and emotional burden it brings, the financial cost to society is huge, currently estimated at more than â‚¬200 billion per annum in Europe and $150 billion per annum in the USA.5 Fewer than 2% of sufferers ever attend a pain clinic6 with the remainder managed mainly in primary care, if anywhere.7 While important recent advances in understanding pain mechanisms bring the possibility of new treatments, management of chronic pain is nonetheless generally unsatisfactory; two-thirds of sufferers report dissatisfaction with current treatment and most chronic pain persists for many years.8 We need to understand the reasons for this, with a view to improving treatment.

<h4 style="position: center;">Abstract</h4><br /><br />

Most devices measuring the kinematics of masticatory function are cumbersome to setup and not portable. Data collection would be facilitated, particularly in the elderly, if the device used for the objective measurement of mastication was easily transportable and simple to setup.<br /><br /> 

Accelerometers and gyroscope sensors are lightweight and portable and may be useful alternatives. The definition of the turning point between the opening and closing phases of chewing is important for studies of associations between muscle activity and effects of perturbations. Measures of the mediolateral angle (specifically, the mandibular tilt from the lateral view) allow the detection of the turning point between the opening and closing phases.<br /><br />

The aim was to determine whether a three-axial gyroscope sensor can detect the turning point between opening and closing phases of chewing. Fourteen asymptomatic participants chewed gum while the output was recorded from a three-axial gyroscope sensor (Seiko Epson, Japan) attached to the chin and a 6 degree-of-freedom electromagnetic jaw-tracking device (Pollhemus, USA).<br /><br />

Bland-Altman plots were used to assess the matching of the recordings made by the three-axial gyroscope sensor and the jaw-tracking device. The turning points between the opening and closing phases of chewing matched closely when recorded by a jaw-tracking device and when using a three-axial gyroscope sensor. A three-axial gyroscope sensor can validly detect the turning point between the opening and closing phases during chewing of gum.
